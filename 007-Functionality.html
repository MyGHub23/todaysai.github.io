                <strong>Based on Functionality:</strong> 
                <span style="display: block; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <strong>1. Reactive Machines:</strong> <br>
                    Reactive Machines represent the simplest form of AI, focusing solely on present scenarios and
                    reacting to them. They lack memory-based functionality and cannot use past experiences for future actions. An
                    example is IBM's Deep Blue chess program, which analyzes and responds to the current state of the
                    game without learning.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>

                    <strong>2. Limited Memory AI:</strong>
                    Limited Memory AI can store and utilize past experiences or data for a short time, enhancing decision-making in the present. This type encompasses most current AI applications, like self-driving cars and personalized recommendation systems, which improve their responses or predictions based on accumulated data but lack long-term memory or learning capabilities. <br>  
                    Examples: Self-driving cars, chatbots.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                    <strong>3. Theory of Mind AI:</strong><br>
                    Theory of Mind AI represents an advanced AI concept aimed at understanding and interpreting human
                    emotions, beliefs, and intentions. This type of AI aspires to interact socially and emotionally like
                    humans, recognizing and responding to human psychological states. However, it remains largely
                    theoretical and under development in the AI research community.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>

                    <strong>4. Self-aware AI:</strong><br>
                    Self-aware AI is a theoretical concept where AI systems possess their own consciousness and
                    self-awareness. Such AI would have a deep understanding of its own existence, emotions, and internal
                    states, mirroring human self-awareness. This advanced form of AI, still in the realm of speculation,
                    raises profound ethical and philosophical questions.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
                Each type represents different stages and potentials in AI development, with varying levels of
                complexity, autonomy, and capabilities.
