            <p class="para1">
                Chatbots and ChatGPT differ mainly in their underlying technology and functionality. Traditional

                Chatbots operate based on pre-set rules and responses, handling inquiries with pre-programmed answers.

                They excel in handling specific tasks but falter with complex or unexpected questions, as they lack the
                ability to understand context or intent beyond their code.
                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                ChatGPT, on the other hand, is powered by advanced AI, specifically OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained
                Transformer. It utilizes machine learning to comprehend and generate human-like text, allowing it to
                respond to a wide array of topics with greater flexibility. ChatGPT's strength lies in its capacity to
                learn from interactions, thereby providing more nuanced and context-aware responses.
                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                Here are the few points as below:

                <span style="display: block; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <strong>Complexity: </strong> 
                    Chatbots use simple rule-based systems, while ChatGPT employs an advanced AI model for nuanced
                    understanding.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>

                    <strong>Interactivity: </strong> 
                    Chatbots have limited conversational flows, but ChatGPT can engage in more fluid, human-like
                    discussions.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                    <strong>Learning: </strong>
                    Unlike static Chatbots, ChatGPT adapts and learns from interactions to improve over time.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>

                    <strong>Response Creation: </strong>
                    Chatbots respond with pre-written answers, whereas ChatGPT dynamically generates each reply.
                    <span class="gap-parainside"></span>

                    <strong>Versatility: </strong>
                    Chatbots serve narrow functions, whereas ChatGPT's wide-ranging capabilities allow it to operate
                    across
                    various tasks and topics.
