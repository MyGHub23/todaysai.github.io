                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with creating smart machines
                <img src="./aiimages/003-whatisAI.jpg" class="img4AI1SmallR" />
                capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

                Imagine a robot or a computer program that can think, learn, and make decisions like a human. That's
                what AI is about.
                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                To build AI, scientists use special computer instructions called algorithms. These algorithms guide the
                AI to learn from examples, much like how we learn from our experiences. For instance, AI can learn to
                recognize photos of animals by seeing lots of animal pictures. This learning ability is a key part of
                what makes AI special.

                AI is not just about robots. It's used in many areas of our lives. For example, in healthcare, AI helps
                doctors diagnose diseases more accurately. In finance, it helps detect fraud. Even in our homes, smart
                devices use AI to make our lives easier.</span>
