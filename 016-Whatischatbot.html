                the Internet. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand
                and respond to user queries in a human-like manner. Chatbots are used in various applications, such as
                customer service, information acquisition, entertainment and used for booking appointments or
                reservations.

                    <strong>Customer Service Bots:</strong> <br>
                    These are used by companies on their websites or social media platforms to answer customer queries,
                    assist with bookings, or provide product information. For instance, many airlines have chatbots for
                    handling flight bookings and inquiries.

                    <strong>Virtual Assistants:</strong> <br>
                    Examples include Siri by Apple, Alexa by Amazon, and Google Assistant by Google. They use voice
                    recognition and AI to perform tasks like setting reminders, playing music, providing weather
                    updates,
                    and controlling smart home devices.

                    <strong>Healthcare Bots:</strong> <br>
                    These are designed to assist patients with medical inquiries, schedule appointments, or even provide
                    preliminary medical advice. Bots like Babylon Health use AI to assess symptoms and offer
                    health-related
                    information.
