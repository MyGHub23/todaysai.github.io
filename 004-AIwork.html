            <p class="para1">
                Artificial Intelligence works like a smart assistant. It uses computers to do tasks that usually need
                <img src="./aiimages/004-Aiwork.jpg" class="img4AI1SmallR" />
                human brains. These tasks can be things like solving problems or making decisions. AI uses special
                programs to do this, which are called algorithms.

                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                These algorithms enable AI learn from data. It's similar to how you learn to recognize a cat by
                observing many pictures of cats. The more pictures you see, the better you become at distinguishing
                whether you're looking at a cat or not. AI operates in the same way with data: it learns to identify
                patterns.
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
                AI also uses something called machine learning. This means AI can get better over time. It learns from
                experience, just like humans. When AI gets new data, it can improve its algorithms to make better
                decisions in the future. 
                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>

                Lastly, AI can understand and talk in human language. This part of AI is called natural language
                processing. It lets us talk to machines like we talk to people. This is how virtual helpers on phones
                can answer questions and follow commands.
