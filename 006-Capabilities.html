                <strong>Based on Capabilities:</strong>
                <span style="display: block; margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>1. AI (or Weak AI):</strong> <br>
                Narrow or Weak AI specializes in specific tasks, operating within a limited context. Common examples
                include voice assistants like Siri, recommendation systems, and language translation apps. These systems
                mimic human behavior based on algorithms and data, but lack genuine understanding or adaptability beyond
                their programmed capabilities. <br>
                Examples: Chatbots, AI in games, AI for image recognition.
                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                <strong>2. General AI (or Strong AI):</strong><br>
                General AI, also known as Strong AI, refers to a form of artificial intelligence that possesses the
                ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence broadly, much like human intelligence. Unlike
                Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, General AI can perform any intellectual task that a
                human can do. It involves complex problem-solving, decision-making, and learning capabilities across
                various domains. The development of General AI represents a significant leap in AI technology, aiming to
                create machines that can think, reason, and comprehend at a human level but this type of AI remains
                theoretical till now.
                <span class="gap-parainside"></span>
                <strong>3. Superintelligent AI:</strong> <br>
                Superintelligent AI refers to a hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence across all fields,
                including creativity, general wisdom, and problem-solving. This form of AI is highly speculative and
                extends beyond current technology, raising profound questions about ethics, governance, and the future
                relationship between humans and machines.
