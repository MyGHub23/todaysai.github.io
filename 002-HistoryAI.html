                Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has a history that goes back over more than 70 years. It all began in
                <img src="./aiimages/002-historyAI.jpg" class="img4AI1SmallR" />
                the 1950s when scientists started to explore how to make machines think and learn. One key moment was
                when a smart scientist named Alan Turing created a test to see if a machine could fool people into
                thinking it was human. This was the start of what we now call the Turing Test. Then, in 1956, a big
                event at Dartmouth College happened where experts said they could make machines smart in just a few
                months. They were too optimistic, but their meeting was the birth of AI as a field.

                In the next years, AI grew slowly. In the 1960s, the first simple robots were made. They could move and
                'see' things. By the 1980s, AI could understand language a little and help doctors and scientists with
                their work. But computers back then were big and expensive, so it was hard for AI to become really
                popular. Then, everything changed in the 1990s. Computers became smaller, better, and cheaper. People
                everywhere started using the internet. AI researchers used these new computers to create 'machine
                learning' and AI started learning from lots of information. Machine learning made AI much smarter. Now,
                AI is part of many things we use every day. It helps us find places with maps on the internet, it
                recommends what to watch on TV, and it even helps cars drive by themselves. The story of AI is still
                being written as it gets smarter every day. </span> </p>
